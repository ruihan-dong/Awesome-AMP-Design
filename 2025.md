## Comprehensive works

- *Discovery and optimization of antimicrobial peptides from extreme environments on global scale (**Brief Bioinformatics 2025** | [code](https://github.com/HUST-NingKang-Lab/SEGMA))*

- *Design of highly potent antibiofilm, antimicrobial peptides using explainable artificial intelligence (**J Chem Inf Model 2025** | [code](https://github.com/Laboratoire-de-Chemoinformatique/GTM_WAE))*
    - WAE from CLaSS and GTM (generative topology mapping) for antibiofilm and antimicrobial analogs. Data preparation is ambiguous.

- *Mechanism-driven screening of membrane-targeting and pore-forming antimicrobial peptides (**Adv Sci 2025** | [code](https://github.com/ComputBiophys/Pore-Forming_AMP_SVM))*
   - 🎈 Our group's work. The first predictor to recognize membrane-active AMPs, even though it was just an SVM.
   - Success rate is not high (39%).

- *Unveiling novel antimicrobial peptides from the ruminant gastrointestinal microbiomes: A deep learning-driven approach yields an anti-MRSA candidate (**J Adv Res 2025**）*
  - It's unusual that the authors set the maximum length to 300, which is significantly longer than peptides.
  - It looks like Fig. 1 refers to AMP-BERT. By the way, ProtBERT-BFD has been widely used in AMP-related works since AMP-BERT used it. Why did they not test other pretrained language models?
  - Comparison lacks some recent models as baselines.
  - It's interesting to see coarse-grained umbrella sampling to calculate the PMF of membrane penetration.

- *Rational screening of anti-E. coli peptides via GAT-MD integration leveraging foodborne antimicrobial sequence features (**Food Chem 2025**)*
  - Applications in food models are interesting.
  - Docking with common resistance targets is meaningless.
    
- *Tailored structured peptide design with a key-cutting machine approach (**Nat Mach Intell 2025** | [code](https://github.com/LabBiocomp/KCM))*
    - It's not a good idea to design AMP (or some short peptides) as a structure-based case. SSE of optimized AMPs cannot provide something new.

- *DLFea4AMPGen de novo design of antimicrobial peptides by integrating features learned from deep learning models (**Nat Commun 2025** | [code](https://github.com/hgao12345/DLFea4AMPGen))*
    - The anti-oxidative feature is a relatively rare aspect of AMPs.
    - Baselines are out of date. This is somehow understandable. I guess the initial submission date is earlier than the displayed received date. Usually, the model training was finished much earlier.
    - The main highlight of this article is the comprehensive SHAP analysis. As for the development of new AMPs, fixed-length (13AA is short) and fragment combinations hindered exploration in a larger space. The sequences of their candidate AMPs also showed this.
    - ❗The bioactivities of candidate peptides were tested with a single concentration (128 μM). Since they just contained 13 residues, their concentrations in μg/mL are even larger than 128. MICs of only 2 peptides were reported. The same strategy was adopted for hemolysis and cytotoxicity tests.

- *A generative artificial intelligence approach for the discovery of antimicrobial peptides against multidrug-resistant bacteria (**Nat Microbiol 2025** | [code](https://github.com/W1V1995/AMP_Project))*
    - The authors did classification (AMP and toxicity) and generation using the same GPT framework. Large-scale tested peptides (196) with a success rate of 73%.
    - The authors claimed that AMPSorter can handle unnatural AAs - It’s easy to adding tokens. But it’s difficult to generalize to new seqs with such a data insufficiency.
    - Mechanism experiments are sufficient, using a G- and a G+ drug-resistant strains. An RNA-seq data was also showed.
    - By the way, I prefer the preprint title (Large language models enable high-throughput mining and generation of antimicrobial peptides against clinical superbugs).
    - Some figure factors are directly from NBE 2023 or NBT 2022...

- *Deep Learning-Driven Discovery of Novel Antimicrobial Peptides from Large-Scale Protist Genomes and Experimental Characterization (**J Chem Inf Model 2025** | [code](https://github.com/liwenhaoj/protozoa_amp))*

- *Controllable Generation of Pathogen-Specific Antimicrobial Peptides Through Knowledge-Aware Prompt Diffusion Model (**Adv Sci 2025** | [code](https://github.com/wyky481l/KPPepGen))*
    - Developing pathogen-specific peptides is a good point. Actually, most known AMPs can inhibit various pathogens due to a unified mechanism. I guess it’s hard to design selective peptides with current peptide data.
    - ⁉️ I’m curious there were lots of docking results. **AMPs are usually associated with the membrane-disruptive mechanism**, which has been validated in many articles. However, they used protein-protein docking as the main validation approach in this article, even though they used an old TM_tend score (for transmembrane! and highly correlated with hydrophobicity) as a major comparative metric. **If generating specific target-binding AMPs is their aim, they should emphasize it.**
      - It’s true that some AMPs can bind to protein targets, and PBPs are common antibacterial targets. But they should not choose them as validated target structures with no specific concern. Diverse proteins can be peptide-binding targets, and they did not even mention the protein name of their docking target in the main text, as well as the reasons for choosing them. (I have to say, at least they didn't say ‘LPS is a protein’…)
      - I think it’s reasonable to assume that pathogen-specific AMPs are related to some protein targets of different species. However, the results in Fig 2 cannot say anything. What if other methods preferred membrane-active peptides with lower docking scores? Also, the difference in membrane composition can be attributed to specificity.
      - Btw, using trRosetta for peptide structure and ZDOCK for protein-peptide docking is out of date.
    - In experimental validation, it’s better to say focusing *E.coli* and *S.aureus* is because they are the top species in training data, instead of ‘clinically significant pathogens’. *A.baumannii, P.aeruginosa*, or else are much more significant.
      - 2000 sequences were generated as exp candidates. Anyway, at least it’s better than 50,000.
      - MIC indeed shows a certain degree of selectivity of these two bacteria, although activity levels are not impressive. And cell cytotoxicity is good.
      - In the MIC assay, peptides should not solute in DMSO since it is harmful to cells, which may affect the antimicrobial results. I didn’t see a blank control with DMSO in the methods description, and I hoped they used water.

- *Painting Peptides with Antimicrobial Potency through Deep Reinforcement Learning (**Adv Sci 2025** | [code](https://github.com/ComputBiophys/AMPainter))*
    - 🎈Our latest work
    - AMPainter is a reinforcement learning-based framework for the evolutionary design of AMPs. It can evolve AMPs from known AMPs, membrane-active signal peptides, and random sequences with an experimental hit rate exceeding 70%.
    - AMPainter relies solely on our antimicrobial score predictor to select sequences, rather than using a series of manually designed filter criteria.
 
- *EBAMP: An efficient de novo broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptide discovery framework (**Cell Rep 2025** | [code](https://github.com/xinxinsus/EBAMP))*
    - The only notable aspect is the large number of tested peptides (256). The success rate (37.5%) is low, even for generative models, yet they still provide a comparison table (Fig. 6M).
    - Meanwhile, generating 50,000 candidate peptides is too much to show the capacity of their model.
    - ❓ There are several highly similar sequences among their 256 peptides. Mode collapse is observed for generator, as there are some repeated seqs like ‘FKKFKKFKKFKKFKKFK’, ‘LKLKLKLKLK’, and ‘LALALALALA’. In addition, bsa132 peptide has been found in the DRAMP.

- *Generative latent diffusion language modeling yields anti-infective synthetic peptides (**Cell Biomaterials 2025** | [code](https://github.com/programmablebio/amp-diffusion))*
    - Experimental validation of the AMP-Diffusion model. Assembly line work.

- *From AI-driven sequence generation to molecular simulation: a comprehensive framework for antimicrobial peptide discovery (**J Chem Inf Model 2025**)*
    - Recently there are lots of GAN model for AMP, lol.
    - But this paper focus on a pipeline instead of its ‘naive’ GAN model. The authors designed three MD procedures to screen out AMP candidates, including peptide in water, membrane, and a larger membrane system. Why putting peptides in both sides of the membrane?
    - It’s good to provide both the positive (known AMP) and negative (non-AMP) controls for MD pipeline. According to my (limited) experience, it’s quite easy to pass MD2 (distance) while quite difficult to pass MD3 (water permeation). I have to say that running 2 us all-atom simulation is not suitable for screening.
    
- *Evaluation of LLM-generated peptide as foundation template for discovery of effective encrypted AMPs against clinical superbugs (**Microbiol Spectr 2025**)*
    - A successive work of AMPGenix (which is still on Research Square)
    - Using alignment to extract homologs with similar functions is a traditional approach. But here using generative template to extract ‘encrypted AMPs’ rather than screening out them raised an attractive concept, even though the generative model played no actual role.
    - Abundant experiments are mainly for only one peptide, PL-15.

- *Deep learning reveals antibiotics in the archaeal proteome (**Nat Microbiol 2025** | [code](https://gitlab.com/machine-biology-group-public/apex-pathogen))*
    - APEX 1.1

- *A Multi-Property Optimizing Generative Adversarial Network for de novo Antimicrobial Peptide Design (**Adv Sci 2025** | [code](https://github.com/23AIBox/MPOGAN))*
    - Add a figure for experments. I think it’s good to test positive and negative controls in MIC tests.
    - ❓ The numbers of sequences of each generative model are not consistent when comparing in Fig. 2. 
    - ❓ I think their experimental results can only partially reflect the generative capability of MPOGAN. They sampled up to 50,000 candidate seqs and used complex filtering rules, including several antimicrobial predictors, a toxicity predictor, as well as a large number of physicochemical rules and a well-defined length-based score. If we randomly sample 50,000 sequences using these rules, we can also get some good AMPs. 

- *Computational exploration of global venoms for antimicrobial discovery with Venomics artificial intelligence (**Nat Commun 2025**)*

- *Uncovering encrypted antimicrobial peptides in health-associated Lactobacillaceae by large-scale genomics and machine learning (**Microbiome 2025**)*
- *BroadAMP-GPT: AI-Driven generation of broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptides for combating multidrug-resistant ESKAPE pathogens (**Gut Microbes 2025** | [code](https://github.com/LYRHeidi/BroadAMP-GPT))*
    - Figure style looks like NBT 2022
    - ❓”*S. aureus ATCC 29,213, E. coli ATCC 25,922*” Is the comma introduced in proof reading procedure? They appeared many times throughout the article…
    - ❓Randomly select 15 peptides for experimental validation. The authors reported a success rate of 57%, but how was it calculated?
    - ❓Surprisingly, MIC prediction models are all classifiers for ‘low-MIC’ or ‘high-MIC’ groups. Why did authors choose different thresholds (16 μg/mL for *E.coli* and 32 μg/mL for *S.aureus*)? To balance positive and negative samples?
    - Two peptides were tested with several antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant strains.
    - The x-axis label of Fig.5 d-e should not be ‘times’. The units of both x and y axis are missing.

- *Unveiling the evolution of antimicrobial peptides in gut microbes via foundation model-powered framework (**Cell Rep 2025** | [code](https://github.com/zjlab-BioGene/AMP-SEMiner))*
    - Develop a residue-level AMP predictor (fine-tuning ESM2) to directly mine encrypted AMPs from proteomes, instead of simply focusing on smORFs or proteolytic fragments. The computational validation is systematic.
    - In vitro successful rate of 9/20 is not that good. Btw the selection criteria are not very clear (similar to many other works), e.g., rule 1 (2+ Cys) covers rule 2 (3+ Cys).
    - Structural clustering confuses me since the short length limits the structural diversity of peptides. Peptides also exhibit flexible conformations under different environments. Can FoldSeek handle such short peptides well?
    - It’s interesting to analyze the adaptive evolution of AMPs interacting with the environment, and there are a lot of things that warrant further exploration.

- *Harnessing advanced computational approaches to design novel antimicrobial peptides against intracellular bacterial infections (**Bioactive Materials 2025**)*
    - A repurposing work for cell-penetrating peptides as AMPs. Only one effective peptide is reported, whose MIC values are not attracting.
    - A relatively complete MD study on pure POPC or POPG/POPE membranes.
    
- *CPL-Diff: A Diffusion Model for De Novo Design of Functional Peptide Sequences with Fixed Length (**Adv Sci 2025** | [code](https://github.com/luozhenjie1997/CPL-Diff))*
    - I’m really surprised fixed length control can be the main motivation of a sequence generation model in 2025 now…
    - The other motivation, to generate peptide with specific function, haven’t been validated in this paper. It is quite likely to generate AMPs with antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal functions at the same time with only trained on AMP dataset. And this paper didn’t include any wet-lab validation of selectivity.
    - ⁉️ The authors might be influenced by MMCD to use docking validation. Again, LPS is not a protein… 1,3-beta-glucan is not the name of protein as well… What’s the meaning of docking a predicted peptide structure and a manually picked target?
    - Use pLDDT as an evaluation metric for AMP generation?
    - Some analysis figures are redundant.

- *Rapid Response Antimicrobial Peptide Design Strategy Driven by Meta-Learning for Emerging Drug-Resistant Pathogens (**J Med Chem 2025** | [code](https://github.com/lennonyu11234/Archeologist_RR-ADS))*
    - Font makes figures really difficult to read… The score legends of scatters and heatmaps are missing.
    - Meta learning and reinforcement learning (REINVENT), targeting MDRAB.

- *AI-Guided Design of Antimicrobial Peptide Hydrogels for Precise Treatment of Drug-resistant Bacterial Infections (**Adv Mater 2025**)*
    - An application of AMP-Designer (AMP-Hydrogel-Designer).
    - Cys is supported. But only one peptide is reported. 

- *De novo design of self-assembling peptides with antimicrobial activity guided by deep learning (**Nat Mater 2025** | [code](https://github.com/LiuHuayang27/TransSAFP))*
    - Introduces 11 N-terminal modification blocks for peptides.
    - Could not be claimed as ‘de novo design’ - it’s a screening process guided by a classifier, not generation.
    - ⁉️ No independent test set for the evaluation of fine-tuned model. Successful rate was only calculated on antimicrobial activity, even most sequences were known AMPs adding N-termial modifications.
    - I think the relationship between ‘self-assembling’ and ‘antimicrobial’ can be discussed more. In this article, these two features of most screened peptides have been validated separately. At least, this shows the effectiveness of their transfer learning strategy (pretrain on AMP and finetune on self-assembling peptide). As for p45, self-assembling events occur before binding to membranes. Then what’s its mechanism? Barrel-stave or toroidal-pore? Since we often think the oligomerization could be influenced by membrane environments, is there any difference for the peptides which can self-assemble in solution?

- *Machine learning-driven discovery of highly selective antifungal peptides containing non-canonical β-amino acids (**Chem Sci 2025** | [code](https://github.com/jdrichardson97/Peptide-GPR))*
    - Interactive computational and experimtental iteration with GPR model.
    - Building ML models for chemical modifications is the future trend.
      
- *Discovery of antimicrobial peptides with notable antibacterial potency by an LLM-based foundation model (**Sci Adv 2025** | [code](https://github.com/jkwang93/AMP-Designer))*
    - Looks like a twin of MCMG.
    - The application case of *P. acnes* is interesting and useful.
    - I prefer this article's originial title which highlighted the 'foundation model'. Their MIC results do not display 'notable antibacterial potency'. 

- *Deep Learning Combined with Quantitative Structure‒Activity Relationship Accelerates De Novo Design of Antifungal Peptides (**Adv Sci 2025** | [code](https://github.com/DongYin521/AFP_DL-QSARES))*

- *Artificial intelligence using a latent diffusion model enables the generation of diverse and potent antimicrobial peptides (**Sci Adv 2025** | [code](https://github.com/Wangyj2023/PepDiffusion))*
    - Generally, the article is well-written
    - Transformer VAE with latent diffusion, to generate antibacterial or antifungal peptides.
    - No description of clustering (only a sentence *“clustering based on their interactions with membranes”*. I didn’t find any other details in the methods section).
        - Something was missed in MD procedure: the initial conformation of peptide and membrane and the definition of peptide-membrane distance (why negative value means peptides away from membrane?)
        - The standard of selecting top 40 candidate peptides is ambiguous
    - *“The simulation results demonstrated that both peptides bind the lipid membrane in parallel, which is consistent with the toroidal pore model”* — how can authors draw this conclusion from a simulation system with only one peptide? Parallel binding is the first step of different membrane-lysis mechanisms, not only the barrel-stave but the toroidal pore models.

- *Explainable deep learning and virtual evolution identifies antimicrobial peptides with activity against multidrug-resistant human pathogens (**Nat Microbiol 2025** | [code](https://github.com/MicroResearchLab/AMP-potency-prediction-EvoGradient))*
    - The ensemble model is simple (and perhaps referred to NBT 2022), but the details are appreciated:
        - Adding a loss focusing on precision
        - Randomly removing the starting ‘M’ of negative sequences from Uniprot
        - Transferred the layer of classifier to the regressor
    - For the gradient-based explanation and evolution, two AMPs with known analogs were used for validation (but it looks like this part was from a reviewer). And the motif recognition part is useful.
    - Six peptides were tested with N/C-amidation. But only one peptide went through animal tests and mechanism tests.
    - Maybe the unfortunate part is ‘virtual evolution’. It’s not very clear how to choose initial sequences and their evolved results. The sequences and mutations in this process can also be discussed.
      
- *Screening and identification of antimicrobial peptides from the gut microbiome of cockroach Blattella germanica (**Microbiome 2025** | [code](https://github.com/ChenSizhe13893461199/Fast-AMPs-Discovery-Projects))*
    - It’s interesting to find modifications between the biorxiv version and the published version. For example, AF2 structure of AMP1 in biorxiv is an alpha-helix and AF3 structure is a beta-sheet.
    - I think the cell-free synthesis screening is meaningless - it’s easy to test 5 chemically synthesized peptides. I guess this part is added following the *Nat Commun* paper.

  - First, *E. coli* does not belong to ESKAPE…
  - I have to say it’s my first time seeing docking with the membrane. Since the author already knows how to build a membrane using CHARMM-GUI, why not run a simple MD simulation?
  - Btw, I’m also surprised my elife paper is cited for membrane composition... At least AMPredictor is worth being compared as an *E. coli* MIC predictor.
  - What’s the ‘AMP-MIC’ in table 2?
  - Pathogen-targeted AMP is a good point. I think it would be better to show selective activity towards the targeted bacteria (for example, the top 10 AMPs targeting *E. coli* have larger MIC against *S. aureus*). Anyway, I understand that a computational group might not have experimental conditions, but usually, just having predicted results isn't enough to convince readers.

  - FBGAN utilized DNA sequences to design AMPs, and this work did so. I think this step is somewhat redundant because we used chemical synthesis to produce AMPs rather than biological expression. Using cDNA increases the length and complexity.

  - Two tasks, AMP (being AMP and MIC activity) and AVP (target binding affinity and toxicity)
    - Two objects for AMP task should be designed more carefully. Why not toxicity or diversity? $$P_{AMP}$$ and $$P_{MIC}$$ are highly related and we only care about highly active ones.
  - A work following HydrAMP.
