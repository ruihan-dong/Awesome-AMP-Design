## Preprints

- *Painting Peptides with Antimicrobial Potency through Deep Reinforcement Learning (**bioRxiv 2025**)*
    - üéàOur latest work
    - AMPainter is a reinforcement learning-based framework for the evolutionary design of AMPs. It can evolve AMPs from known AMPs, membrane-active signal peptides, and random sequences with an experimental hit rate exceeding 70%.
    - AMPainter relies solely on our antimicrobial score predictor to select sequences, rather than using a series of manually designed filter criteria.

- *ProtFlow: Fast Protein Sequence Design via Flow Matching on Compressed Protein Language Model Embeddings (**arXiv 2025**)*
    - A flow-matching generative model with AMP generation as a task.
      
- *Design of highly potent anti-biofilm, antimicrobial peptides using explainable artificial intelligence (**bioRxiv 2025** | [code](https://github.com/Laboratoire-de-Chemoinformatique/GTM_WAE))*
    - WAE from CLaSS and GTM (generative topology mapping) for antibiofilm and antimicrobial analogs. Data preparation is ambiguous.
- *Unveiling the evolution of antimicrobial peptides in gut microbes via foundation model-powered framework (**bioRxiv 2025** | [code](https://github.com/zjlab-BioGene/AMP-SEMiner))*
    - The model is the fine-tuned ESM-2. Structure clustering and conservation analysis are included.
- *Discovery of antibiotics in the archaeome using deep learning (**bioRxiv 2025** | [code](https://gitlab.com/machine-biology-group-public/apex-pathogen))*
- *Venomics AI: a computational exploration of global venoms for antibiotic discovery (**bioRxiv 2025**)*
- *Design of multimodal antibiotics against intracellular infections using deep learning¬†(**bioRxiv 2024** | [code](https://gitlab.com/machine-biology-group-public/apex_duo))*
    - Multimodal represents cell-penetration and AMP - Did they consider that many known AMPs are already cell-penetration peptides?
    - The training set of cell-penetration predictor is weird - added toxic peptides into the negative set
    - I like Fig. 4A because it‚Äôs direct to see residues that contributed to antimicrobial activity as well as toxicity. Btw, the x-axis label should be F1A instead of A1F (same for other sites)
- *A generative artificial intelligence approach for antibiotic optimization¬†(**bioRxiv 2024** | [code](https://github.com/Yimeng-Zeng/APEXGo))*
- *De novo multi-mechanism antimicrobial peptide design via multimodal deep learning (**bioRxiv 2024**)*
    - A really complex model with structures and limited strain/mechanism labels.
- *A Multi-Property Optimizing Generative Adversarial Network for de novo Antimicrobial Peptide Design (**bioRxiv 2024** | [code](https://github.com/23AIBox/MPOGAN))*
    - Not many experiments. I think it‚Äôs good to test positive and negative controls in MIC tests.
- *Discovery of antimicrobial peptides targeting Acinetobacter baumannii via a pre-trained and finetuned few-shot learning-based pipeline (**Research Square 2024**)*
    - The subsequent work of *Nat Biomed Eng* 2023, focusing on *A.baumannii*.
- *MoFormer: Multi-objective Antimicrobial Peptide Generation Based on Conditional Transformer Joint Multi-modal Fusion Descriptor (**arXiv 2024**)*
- *Key-cutting machine: A novel optimization framework for tailored protein and peptide design (**bioRxiv 2025**)*
- *Design guidelines for Œ±-helical peptides that self-assemble into transmembrane barrel pores killing antibiotic-resistant bacteria (**bioRxiv 2022**)*


## Comprehensive works (with comments)

*in silico* mining/generation + *in vitro/in vivo* validations

- *CPL-Diff: A Diffusion Model for De Novo Design of Functional Peptide Sequences with Fixed Length (**Adv Sci 2025** | [code](https://github.com/luozhenjie1997/CPL-Diff))*
    - I‚Äôm really surprised fixed length control can be the main motivation of a sequence generation model in 2025 now‚Ä¶
    - The other motivation, to generate peptide with specific function, haven‚Äôt been validated in this paper. It is quite likely to generate AMPs with antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal functions at the same time with only trained on AMP dataset. And this paper didn‚Äôt include any wet-lab validation of selectivity.
    - ‚ÅâÔ∏è¬†The authors might be influenced by MMCD to use docking validation. Again, LPS is not a protein‚Ä¶ 1,3-beta-glucan is not the name of protein as well‚Ä¶ What‚Äôs the meaning of docking a predicted peptide structure and a manually picked target?
    - Use pLDDT as an evaluation metric for AMP generation?
    - Some analysis figures are redundant.

- *Rapid Response Antimicrobial Peptide Design Strategy Driven by Meta-Learning for Emerging Drug-Resistant Pathogens (**J Med Chem 2025** | [code](https://github.com/lennonyu11234/Archeologist_RR-ADS))*
    - Font makes figures really difficult to read‚Ä¶ The score legends of scatters and heatmaps are missing.
    - Meta learning and reinforcement learning (REINVENT), targeting MDRAB.

- *AI-Guided Design of Antimicrobial Peptide Hydrogels for Precise Treatment of Drug-resistant Bacterial Infections (**Adv Mater 2025**)*
    - An application of AMP-Designer (AMP-Hydrogel-Designer).
    - Cys is supported. But only one peptide is reported. 

- *De novo design of self-assembling peptides with antimicrobial activity guided by deep learning (**Nat Mater 2025** | [code](https://github.com/LiuHuayang27/TransSAFP))*
    - Introduces 11 N-terminal modification blocks for peptides.
    - Could not be claimed as ‚Äòde novo design‚Äô - it‚Äôs a screening process guided by a classifier, not generation.
    - ‚ÅâÔ∏è¬†No independent test set for the evaluation of fine-tuned model. Successful rate was only calculated on antimicrobial activity, even most sequences were known AMPs adding N-termial modifications.
    - I think the relationship between ‚Äòself-assembling‚Äô and ‚Äòantimicrobial‚Äô can be discussed more. In this article, these two features of most screened peptides have been validated separately. At least, this shows the effectiveness of their transfer learning strategy (pretrain on AMP and finetune on self-assembling peptide). As for p45, self-assembling events occur before binding to membranes. Then what‚Äôs its mechanism? Barrel-stave or toroidal-pore? Since we often think the oligomerization could be influenced by membrane environments, is there any difference for the peptides which can self-assemble in solution?

- *Machine learning-driven discovery of highly selective antifungal peptides containing non-canonical Œ≤-amino acids (**Chem Sci 2025** | [code](https://github.com/jdrichardson97/Peptide-GPR))*
    - Interactive computational and experimtental iteration with GPR model.
    - Building ML models for chemical modifications is the future trend.
      
- *Discovery of antimicrobial peptides with notable antibacterial potency by an LLM-based foundation model¬†(**Sci Adv 2025** | [code](https://github.com/jkwang93/AMP-Designer))*
    - Looks like a twin of MCMG.
    - The application case of *P. acnes* is interesting and useful.
    - I prefer this article's originial title which highlighted the 'foundation model'. Their MIC results do not display 'notable antibacterial potency'. 

- *Deep Learning Combined with Quantitative Structure‚ÄíActivity Relationship Accelerates De Novo Design of Antifungal Peptides (**Adv Sci 2025** | [code](https://github.com/DongYin521/AFP_DL-QSARES))*

- *Artificial intelligence using a latent diffusion model enables the generation of diverse and potent antimicrobial peptides (**Sci Adv 2025** | [code](https://github.com/Wangyj2023/PepDiffusion))*
    - Generally, the article is well-written
    - Transformer VAE with latent diffusion, to generate antibacterial or antifungal peptides.
    - No description of clustering (only a sentence *‚Äúclustering based on their interactions with membranes‚Äù*. I didn‚Äôt find any other details in the methods section).
        - Something was missed in MD procedure: the initial conformation of peptide and membrane and the definition of peptide-membrane distance (why negative value means peptides away from membrane?)
        - The standard of selecting top 40 candidate peptides is ambiguous
    - *‚ÄúThe simulation results demonstrated that both peptides bind the lipid membrane in parallel, which is consistent with the toroidal pore model‚Äù* ‚Äî how can authors draw this conclusion from a simulation system with only one peptide? Parallel binding is the first step of different membrane-lysis mechanisms, not only the barrel-stave but the toroidal pore models.

- *Explainable deep learning and virtual evolution identifies antimicrobial peptides with activity against multidrug-resistant human pathogens (**Nat Microbiol 2025** | [code](https://github.com/MicroResearchLab/AMP-potency-prediction-EvoGradient))*
    - The ensemble model is simple (and perhaps referred to NBT 2022), but the details are appreciated:
        - Adding a loss focusing on precision
        - Randomly removing the starting ‚ÄòM‚Äô of negative sequences from Uniprot
        - Transferred the layer of classifier to the regressor
    - For the gradient-based explanation and evolution, two AMPs with known analogs were used for validation (but it looks like this part was from a reviewer). And the motif recognition part is useful.
    - Six peptides were tested with N/C-amidation. But only one peptide went through animal tests and mechanism tests.
    - Maybe the unfortunate part is ‚Äòvirtual evolution‚Äô. It‚Äôs not very clear how to choose initial sequences and their evolved results. The sequences and mutations in this process can also be discussed.
      
- *Screening and identification of antimicrobial peptides from the gut microbiome of cockroach Blattella germanica (**Microbiome 2025** | [code](https://github.com/ChenSizhe13893461199/Fast-AMPs-Discovery-Projects))*
    - It‚Äôs interesting to find modifications between the biorxiv version and the published version. For example, AF2 structure of AMP1 in biorxiv is an alpha-helix and AF3 structure is a beta-sheet.
    - I think the cell-free synthesis screening is meaningless - it‚Äôs easy to test 5 chemically synthesized peptides. I guess this part is added following the *Nat Commun* paper.
    
- *ProT-Diff: A Modularized and Efficient Strategy for De Novo Generation of Antimicrobial Peptide Sequences by Integrating Protein Language and Diffusion Models (**Adv Sci 2024**)*
    - Diffusion in ProtT5 embedding space. Success rate is high for a generative model (44/45).
- *Bioprospecting of culturable marine biofilm bacteria for novel antimicrobial peptides (**iMeta 2024** | [code](https://github.com/FAFFASS/AMP_prediction))*
- *A Foundation Model Identifies Broad-Spectrum Antimicrobial Peptides against Drug-Resistant Bacterial Infection (**Nat Commun 2024** | [code](https://github.com/jimmyrate/deepAMP))*
    - Using ‚Äòdegenerative pairs‚Äô to fine-tune a VAE to modify AMP of interest is creative.
    - An important limitation is that the users have to fine-tune a model case-by-case for each peptide of interest.
- *Deep mutational scanning and machine learning for the analysis of antimicrobial-peptide features driving membrane selectivity (**Nat Biomed Eng 2024**)*
    - It‚Äôs really important to focus on the membrane selectivity of AMPs. In this work, they proposed a method (dmSLAY) to measure this feature of protegrin-1 variants and find some new variants with good specificity.
    - But I‚Äôm curious why this article can be published on NBE. For example, figure 2 is hard to analyze and draw a conclusion between secondary structure and MIC.
- *Computational Design of Pore-Forming Peptides with Potent Antimicrobial and Anticancer Activities (**J Med Chem 2024**)*
  - Design pore-forming AMPs based on coarse-grained MD simulations. 
- *Discovery of antimicrobial peptides in the global microbiome with machine learning (**Cell 2024**)*
    - I‚Äôm not familiar with genome analysis but no doubt this part is the highlight of this article.
- *Mining human microbiomes reveals an untapped source of peptide antibiotics (**Cell 2024**)*
    - People always like large-scale works and the potential mining space of AMPs remains scarce after these two cell papers.
    - We found some missing figure legends in Figures S4 and S5.
- *Deep-learning-enabled antibiotic discovery through molecular de-extinction (**Nat Biomed Eng 2024** | [code](https://gitlab.com/machine-biology-group-public/apex))*
    - I have been thinking for quite a while about how to build a multi-task MIC predictor on different bacterial species with scarce data. It‚Äôs an advantage for the de la Fuente group to do this work (APEX) on their in-house data though its accuracy is limited.
    - Molecular de-extinction is also a great concept.
- *Exploring the repository of de novo designed bifunctional antimicrobial peptides through deep learning (**eLife 2024** | [code](https://github.com/ruihan-dong/GAN-for-AMP-Design))*
    - üéàThis work is part of my undergraduate thesis.
    - 24 generated peptides have been tested. All these peptides are antibacterial (inhibiting multi-resistant A.baumannii) and about 60% showed antiviral activity on HSV-1 virus. Several peptides got MICs of less than 1 uM against MDRAB.
    - However, the pipeline of selecting bifunctional peptides is not clear. The MD simulation parts are very preliminary.
- *Cell-free biosynthesis combined with deep learning accelerates de novo-development of antimicrobial peptides (**Nat Commun 2023** | [code](https://github.com/amirpandi/Deep_AMP))*
    - The cell-free system is attractive.
    - They used 3 versions of VAE generator and different sequence selection rules. AF2 structures in Fig. 2 are a little messy and maybe plddt should be shown here. Fig. 4 looks good and ESKAPE pathogens were used for MIC tests.
- *Discovering highly potent antimicrobial peptides with deep generative model HydrAMP (**Nat Commun 2023** | [code](https://github.com/szczurek-lab/hydramp))*
    - In my view, the most important contribution of HydrAMP is that they used a VAE to do both ‚Äòanalog generation‚Äô and ‚Äòunconstrained generation‚Äô and showed experimentally validated analogs. Unfortunately, no validation results of unconstrained generated sequences were shown.
    - HydrAMP set two levels of conditions (AMP and MIC classifier). But the intra-connection of the two conditions was not considered and some cases with MIC label 1 and AMP label 0 can be found.
- *Designing antimicrobial peptides using deep learning and molecular dynamic simulations (**Brief Bioinformatics 2023** | [code](https://github.com/gc-js/Antimicrobial-peptide-generation))*
    - Using SeqGAN to design AMPs is a good trial.
- *Identification of potent antimicrobial peptides via a machine-learning pipeline that mines the entire space of peptide sequences (**Nat Biomed Eng 2023**)*
    - The authors established a pipeline of selection, classification, ranking, and regression. It‚Äôs impressive that they experimentally compared different combinations of these steps.
    - I sometimes worry that the more steps a pipeline uses, the more bias each step introduces.
- *Molecular de-extinction of ancient antimicrobial peptides enabled by machine learning (**Cell Host & Microbe 2023** | [code](https://gitlab.com/machine-biology-group-public/pancleave))*
    - The authors used a protease prediction model to ‚Äòcut‚Äô fragments from ancient proteomes, which is better than random sliding windows.
    - The selection rules of AMP candidates are interesting, including human experts, conventional AMP classifiers, and even random choice.
- *Identification of antimicrobial peptides from the human gut microbiome using deep learning (**Nat Biotechnol 2022** | [code](https://github.com/mayuefine/c_AMPs-prediction))*
    - An important work in the field of AMP mining/designing. You can see the impact of this paper in other papers such as the model framework, the figure style, etc.
- *Mining for encrypted peptide antibiotics in the human proteome (**Nat Biomed Eng 2022**)*

  - Two tasks, AMP (being AMP and MIC activity) and AVP (target binding affinity and toxicity)

    - We usually think structural information are not useful since short peptides have simple 3D structures (helix/sheet/loop, maybe secondary structure info is enough), and current structure predictors cannot distinguish the solution/membrane environment. Also, AMPs may oligomerize to function.
